# hospitaldata

# npm i

# npm start 

# If you have webpack-cli installed globablly.  
# webpack

# If you want to have fun with webpack and nerdout a bit
# node_modules/.bin/webpack --json | webpack-bundle-size-analyzer

# The Good:
Backend and Server complete. Can save and delete dummy data. Not from the Front End tho. 
Since I work on controllers and routes alot at work.
React Routers and React Router-Dom implemented from memory pretty okay.
Webpack module Bundler was instaleled with CleanWebpackPlugin + Wwebpack-bundle-size-analyzer (I always set this up as taught by GA and forgot how annoying
it is since I havent made a complete FullStack App since 2017)
MongoDB is connected through Mongoose through their online portal. Where I currently work we used a DATA DUMP file to get dummy data from, as a last resort I was
going to make a dump file and use mongod --path to collect data from the dump file.
Routes are all set up with Express and Node. That was easy.
Whole thing is made entirely from the ground up without even using "Create-React-App", this felt good.
And was having fun with Bootstrap again

# The Bad:
Super Rushed since I had to start from scratch on Thursday afternoon, well Friday if you want to be honest since it took a day to back up from an August 11, 2020
Time Machine backup.
Sloppy. I can add a webpack plugin that can make all certain files have their own directory but at this point, I am alright.
Need Practice fetching Data from an external API. It needs a key which can be found in .env.local but in my Postman application (for API testing) it 
was working fine without one.
Got caught up making dynamic dropdowns with React Fetch but querying the NYC Open Data was not working for me, even prior to laptop failing. 
Haven't made a full stack app since 2017 and that one barely got me passed that coding bootcamp. (lol)
Have not used REACT in a while and it shows. Gatsby.js portfolio is built on REACT and Webpack but it holds your hand with thos modules in that config file it makes.
Was also trying to be fancy and use "Redux + Axios" and that whole store concept at first (if you see the modules I installed). That killed a lot of my time. 
I also never ask for help, as I was taught to figure it out myself all the time (but not during a crunch time.

# In all it was a good experience, I need to brush up on stuff. Especially API fetching again...and learn new technology again liked REDUX + Axios. Damm params...
# I don't know what my grade should be Professor. I am obviously know a lot above the learning criteria but I do have flaws in my skills that are crtitical. 

# While making this Readme I was practing merging with GIT, I hate rebasing with GIT.
